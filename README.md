This repo stores all the StreamLit GUI apps which I build for data analysis and quick
web deployment. 

### autocorrelate.py

This is an educational apps for understanding auto-regression and auto-correlation
by using periodic functions as example. Users can experiment how auto-correlation 
exacts the similarity of the data series and how auto-regression helps predict 
future data based on previous pattern. The role of noise is also explored.
