# streamlit-apps

This repo stores all the StreamLit GUI apps which I build for data analysis and quick
web deployment. 

### autocorrelate.py

This is an educational apps for understanding auto-regression and auto-correlation
by using periodic functions as example. Users can experiment how auto-correlation 
exacts the similarity of the data series and how auto-regression helps predict 
future data based on previous pattern. The role of noise is also explored. 

### airport.py

This is a practical app for finding the connection between two airports based on
flight route database (though last updated in 2014). The position of the destination
and departure airports are also shown in a map for illustration purpose.
